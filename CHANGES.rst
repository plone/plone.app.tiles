3.0.0 (2016-09-15)
------------------

Breaking changes:

- Remove ``Add tile`` (plone.app.tiles.AddTile) permission, because
  it was not use by default and each tiles may have its own add permission
  and use existing permissions like ``cmf.ModifyPortalContent``.

  record is still registered, but not used by plone.app.tiles

  version is restored, the blob and relation versions from the current
  working copy version are applied for the restored version
  [datakurre]

- Add new vocabularies *plone.app.tiles.RegisteredTiles*,
  *plone.app.tiles.AvailableTiles* and *plone.app.tiles.AllowedTiles* to
  list all registered tiles, tiles available in the current context
  and tiles allowed to be added in the current context by the current user

  plone.app.drafts.interfaces.IDisplayFormDrafting
