plone.app.tiles
===============

Plone UI integration for `plone.tiles <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.tiles>`_.

This package contains the following things:

* A view ``@@add-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to create a
  new tile based on the tile's schema. For transient tiles, this merely
  redirects to a URL with an appropriate query string. For persistent tiles,
  it will also save the necessary data. This will fire an 
  ``IObjectCreatedEvent`` as well as an ``IObjectAddedEvent`` for the newly
  created tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted. In the case
  of the ``IObjectAddedEvent``, the ``newParent`` attribute will be the tile's
  context, and the ``newName`` attribute will be the tile's id.

* The ``@@add-tile`` view, when accessed directly, allows the user to choose
  from all available tiles (subject to the tile's add permission) and
  redirects to the appropriate ``@@add-tile/<tile-type>`` URL to configure the
  tile.

* A view ``@@edit-tile``, and an associated form, which can be used to edit a
  tile based on the tile's schema. This will fire an ``IObjectModifiedEvent``
  for the modified tile (a transient object) when successfully submitted.

* A view ``@@delete-tile``, where the user may select a tile type, enter a tile
  id, and opt to clear out any persistent data for that tile. This can also be
  called by AJAX code given appropriate request parameters. This will fire an
  ``IObjectRemovedEvent`` for the removed tile (a transient object). The
  ``oldParent`` attribute will be the tile's context, and the ``oldName``
  attribute will be the tile's id.

The default add and edit forms should suffice for most use cases. You can use
`plone.autoform <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.autoform>`_ to configure
alternative widgets, either by hand or via `plone.directives.form
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.directives.form>`_.

If you need a custom form, you can register an add view as an adapter from
``(context, request, tileType)``, where ``tileType`` is an instance providing
``plone.tiles.interfaces.ITileType``.

The actual integration of the various views is left up to other packages (such
as the Deco editor).
